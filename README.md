Attiny85 + Bme280 + I2C Oled display

# What is this?

I created a pcb from the ground up around an attiny85, an I2C Oled display and the bme280 sensor. (The schematics and project files will be uploaded soon)
The board has 3 buttons that help with the navigation of the device. The board has 2 modes, in one of them it shows images and text (no sensor readings) and a second one (press the select button once) in which you will get the temperature and humidity on page 1 and on page 2 (press left or right) the pressure (no altitude yet)
